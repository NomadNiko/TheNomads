Fryer Fisticuffs is a top down survival game developed in Unity3D. This game was made by a team of 8 hardworking individuals, for Github's Game Off Game Jam.
In this game, players try to survive as they combat waves of enemies (melee and ranged), as well as environmental hazards! If you can somehow make it through all that chaos, be prepared to take on Sous Chef Shrimp Boss!

## So many fun ways to play
For this game, we wanted the experience to be creative and fun. Our focus was mainly on implementing features, which allows for the player to play anyway they want, whether that be 
- Moving tables around to create a defensive base
- Cashing in your scales to buy some fun powerups at the vending machine
- Or cooking the killer shrimp with molotovs!


## Features
- **Dynamic Enemy Spawning:** Enemies spawn in waves, with increasing difficulty.
- **NavMesh AI:** Enemies use Unity's NavMesh system for pathfinding and chasing the player.
- **Player Mechanics:** The player character can move, punch, and interact with the game environment.
- **Projectile System:** Ranged enemies shoot projectiles that the player must dodge.
- **Throwables:** The player can pickup and throw objects to deal damage
